# DigiVoter: Secure Decentralized Voting on the Internet Computer 🗳️

**A secure, transparent, and user-friendly decentralized voting application built entirely on the Internet Computer Protocol (ICP).**

DigiVoter leverages the power of the Internet Computer to create a robust and trustworthy platform for conducting online elections. It aims to address the challenges of traditional online voting systems (like security vulnerabilities, lack of transparency, and potential for censorship) by providing enhanced security, verifiable transparency, and user anonymity through blockchain technology.

## ✨ Features

* 🗳️ **Create & Manage Elections:** Easily set up new elections with titles, detailed descriptions, candidate/option lists, and defined start/end times.
* 🔐 **Secure User Authentication:** Integrates with secure authentication mechanisms suitable for the IC environment (e.g., Internet Identity) to ensure only eligible users participate.
* 👤 **Anonymous & Private Voting:** Designed to ensure voter privacy by separating voter identity from their cast vote, preventing coercion and ensuring confidentiality.
* 📊 **Real-time & Transparent Results:** Observe election results update live *after* the voting period concludes, ensuring transparency while maintaining vote secrecy during the election. Tallies are verifiable on-chain.
* 🧾 **Verifiable Vote Receipts:** (Optional/Implementation Dependent) Provides users with cryptographic proof that their vote was correctly cast and included in the final tally.
* 🌐 **Fully On-Chain:** Runs entirely on the Internet Computer, benefiting from its speed, scalability, security, and tamper-proof nature. No reliance on centralized servers.
* ✅ **End-to-End Verifiability:** From canister code deployment to vote casting and tallying, the process aims for maximum transparency and auditability.

## 🤔 Why DigiVoter on the Internet Computer?

* **True Decentralization:** No single entity controls the application or the voting data, eliminating single points of failure and control.
* **Enhanced Security:** Leverages the cryptographic security, consensus mechanisms, and Sybil resistance inherent to the Internet Computer.
* **Transparency:** All canister code (backend logic) and election data (anonymized votes, results) can be publicly audited on the blockchain.
* **Censorship Resistance:** Highly resistant to external interference or attempts to shut down or manipulate the voting process.
* **Direct Web Serving:** Serves the frontend directly from the blockchain, reducing reliance on traditional web hosting infrastructure.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

* **Frontend:** [React.js](https://reactjs.org/) - A popular JavaScript library for building dynamic and interactive user interfaces.
* **Backend Canisters:** [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) - A performant and memory-safe language used for writing secure smart contracts (canisters) on the Internet Computer.
* **Blockchain Platform:** [Internet Computer Protocol (ICP)](https://internetcomputer.org/) - The underlying decentralized cloud platform providing compute, storage, and consensus.
* **IC SDK:** `dfx` - The command-line interface and SDK for developing and deploying applications on the Internet Computer.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a local copy up and running for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following tools installed on your system:

1.  **DFX (The IC SDK):** Required to build, deploy, and interact with Internet Computer applications.
    * [Installation Guide](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/setup/install/)
    * Quick Install (Linux/macOS):
        ```bash
        sh -ci "$(curl -fsSL [https://internetcomputer.org/install.sh](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://internetcomputer.org/install.sh))"
        ```
    * Verify installation: `dfx --version`

2.  **Node.js and npm:** Required for the React frontend development environment.
    * [Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (LTS version is generally recommended)
    * Verify installation: `node -v` and `npm -v`

### Installation & Local Deployment

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/akshat-shah-017/DigiVoter.git](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://github.com/akshat-shah-017/DigiVoter.git)
    cd DigiVoter
    ```

2.  **Install frontend dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Start the local Internet Computer replica:**
    It's recommended to run the local replica in a separate terminal window/tab as it provides ongoing status logs.
    ```bash
    # Navigate to your project directory (DigiVoter) in a new terminal
    dfx start --background --clean
    ```
    * `--background` runs the replica process in the background.
    * `--clean` starts with a fresh state, useful for avoiding potential conflicts from previous runs.

4.  **Deploy the canisters (backend logic):**
    In your original terminal window (within the `DigiVoter` directory):
    ```bash
    dfx deploy
    ```
    * This command compiles the Rust canister code, deploys it to your local replica, and generates necessary interface files for the frontend.

5.  **Run the frontend development server:**
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
    This command will typically:
    * Build the React application.
    * Start a local development server (often on `http://localhost:3000` or a similar port).
    * Open the application automatically in your default web browser. Check the terminal output for the exact URL.

### Usage Guide

Once the application is running in your browser:

1.  **Authentication:** Connect using the required method (e.g., a development identity provided by the local replica, or integrate with Internet Identity for mainnet/testing).
2.  **Create Election (Admin Role):** Navigate to the election creation section. Fill in the necessary details like title, description, voting options/candidates, and the start/end date and time for the voting period.
3.  **Cast Vote (Voter Role):** Browse available active elections. Select your preferred option and submit your vote securely.
4.  **View Results:** After an election's end time has passed, navigate to the results page to view the final, transparent tally.
